Sesame seeds are a good source of healthy fats, protein, B vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and other beneficial plant compounds. Regularly eating substantial portions of these seeds — not just an occasional sprinkling on a burger bun — may aid blood sugar control, combat arthritis pain, and lower cholesterol.


THE IMPORTANCE OF SESAME SEEDS FOR NIGERIA’S ECONOMY
Nigeria is a country rife with poverty. Between 1980 and 2010, it saw a drastic 153.6% increase in poverty, even though its per capita GDP rose by about 19% during this period. According to a recent World Bank Report, around four in 10 Nigerians were living in poverty as of 2022, many of them in Northern Nigeria.

However, the production of sesame seeds in Northern Nigeria has been providing hope for the region’s poor. The seed is in major demand around the world and, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Nigeria was the world’s sixth-largest exporter of sesame seeds in 2021, making sesame seeds the country’s second most lucrative export after cocoa. With much sesame seed cultivation concentrated in the north and international demand for sesame seeds expected to continue rising, the seeds are playing a key role in reducing poverty in Northern Nigeria and improving the country’s economy as a whole.

Economic Importance of Sesame Seed in Nigeria
The flowering plant that produces sesame seeds can thrive in Northern Nigeria because it is resistant to drought. It is a high-value crop because both the seeds and the oil extracted from them are common food staples around the world, used in sweets, breads and everyday cooking. Additionally, a variety of non-food products, including ulcer and burn medicines and aerosol sprays, incorporate sesame oil. Lower-quality sesame oil can be used in making lubricants, while the shafts from processed seeds can be used as animal feed.

Nigeria exports an estimated 90% of its sesame seeds, with China and Japan being major importers. According to Sheriff Balogun, president of the National Sesame Seed Association of Nigeria, the country generates $700 million from sesame exports yearly, which equates to about $1400 per metric tonne of exported seed.

While several years ago, only a few Nigerian states were cultivating sesame seed, it is now produced in 26 states, with the country’s top producers being in the north. Exports to Japan, especially, have had a positive impact on Nigeria’s economy. Japan imports about 40% of its sesame seeds from Nigeria, and the trade volume between the two countries reached $1 billion in 2022. Between 2020 and 2021, Nigeria’s income from agricultural exports rose by an estimated 57.02%, a boost that sesame exports, which increased from 98.27 billion naira to 113.2 billion naira, played critical roles in propelling.

Efforts To Boost the Nigerian Economy with Sesame Seed
Despite the poverty and food insecurity that many in Northern Nigeria face, there have been ongoing efforts to help farmers in the region thrive so that they can build a better future for themselves and their families. For instance, the FAO and World Food Programme (WFP) have partnered to help farmers in Northeastern Nigeria improve food production, with the goal of ensuring them a secure source of both income and sustenance. By supplying seeds, fertilizer and food to nourish households until a successful harvest, the initiative provided vital support for all 67,000 inhabitants of the town of Rann in 2018.

More recently, the Japanese Government announced plans to invest $30 billion in Nigeria and other African countries in the next three years. Japan hopes to help further boost Nigeria’s economy and strengthen mutually beneficial trade relations between both nations.

Additionally, the Central Bank of Nigeria has allocated 21 billion Naira to expand Nigeria’s production and export of sesame seeds and cocoa. The initiative aims to increase the country’s foreign exchange income through agricultural commodities, in part by providing loans to smallholder farmers.

Looking Ahead
Though many Nigerians, especially in the north, are struggling with poverty and food insecurity, sesame seed cultivation presents hope for the country’s future economic growth. With continued national and international support, Nigeria’s sesame seed industry shows signs of expanding and paving the way for secure livelihoods and a thriving economy for Nigerians.

It responds to the deep-rooted crisis of out-of-school children in Northern Nigeria, especially among the Almajiri population. At its core, the project is about giving every child regardless of their background a real shot at education, dignity, and a future. It combines foundational literacy, values-driven learning, and hands-on vocational skills in a flexible model that respects local cultures and realities. EBB is not just about classrooms; it’s about building hope, self-worth, and human potential in places long overlooked.",,,2025-04-19 06:48:46.571902+00,,"The project began in Niger State and is expanding to reach more states with high numbers of out-of-school children. Next in line are Kano, Kaduna, Borno and Bauchi states that reflect both the scale of the challenge and the urgent need for solutions. While the focus remains on underserved rural and peri-urban communities, the model is adaptable across all 19 Northern states. Educational materials are sourced locally where possible, while partnerships help provide additional tools and technologies that enhance the learning experience.","Key players in this journey include the State Ministries of Education, Local Government Authorities, community leaders, and faith-based institutions. The National Commission for Almajiri and Out-of-School Children Education is an essential partner for policy alignment and long-term integration. CESi also works closely with local NGOs, civil society organizations and private sector players with an interest in youth development and education. These groups support mobilization, advocacy, psychosocial care and access to vocational resources. Together, they form a community of practice driving a shared vision for change.","So far, CESi has carried the project largely on its own shoulders with dedication, resourcefulness and limited but valuable support from a few local partners. The structure is built on community-public collaboration, guided by a vision aligned with the Northern Economic Agenda. Each learning center functions semi-independently,with local oversight and monitoring frameworks. While the governance architecture is still evolving, CESi remains committed to transparency, data collection and learning from the field. The goal is to build a system that is accountable, inclusive, and resilient over time.","Funding for EBB has been largely self-financed by the founders. Despite the scale and ambition of the initiative, CESi has yet to secure any major institutional funding. This hasn’t slowed the work it’s only made the team more determined. The financial model, as envisioned, blends future support from development agencies, philanthropists and government with potential revenue from vocational training output, alumni networks, and in-kind community contributions. The model is modest but deeply rooted in the belief that small beginnings can yield lasting change.","In 10 years, CESi envisions reaching 100,000 out-of-school children, many of whom would have otherwise remained invisible. These children will have basic literacy, confidence, and a foundation to dream and grow.

In 30 years, the project will have created ripple effects in thousands of families raising educated citizens,reducing street vulnerability, and nurturing young entrepreneurs, artisans, and change-makers.

By 50 years, the EBB model will stand as a legacy proof that with community, grit and compassion, a region once held back by neglect can become a beacon for education-driven transformation. Across Africa, the model could be adapted in places facing similar challenges rooted in local ownership, and powered by collective will.",Niger

Background

As a development practitioner with hands-on experience in health, education, agriculture, and community empowerment, I have witnessed firsthand the critical challenges women and children face across regions. These challenges include poverty, limited access to healthcare, poor educational outcomes, and economic disempowerment. A comprehensive, locally-driven solution is essential to change this narrative.

The Idea

I propose the establishment of Women and Children Empowerment Resource Hubs (WACER Hubs)—community-based centers designed to support women and children through access to economic opportunities, education, health services, legal support, and digital tools. These hubs will serve as inclusive spaces where transformation begins at the grassroots.

Key Components

1. Women’s Microenterprise Corner

Vocational training (tailoring, soap-making, agro-processing, etc.)

Access to microcredit and cooperative savings groups

Enterprise mentorship, branding, and market linkage facilitation


2. Child Development Zone

Free early childhood education and after-school learning support

Nutrition, immunization, and health screenings

Safe spaces for creative play and cognitive development


3. Legal & Social Support Services

Gender-Based Violence (GBV) reporting and support services

Civic documentation (birth certificates, ID registration)

Legal literacy sessions on women and children’s rights


4. Tech for Inclusion Lab

Digital literacy programs for women and adolescents

The intention of this concept is to create massive job and business opportunities, guaranty market for crop farmers, improved revenue for the states concerned through taxes and levies and creation of wealth for the general populace through the vast value chains involved in the cluster from cultivation of the crop, processing of the crop, logistics services and supporting services. 
The Cluster will contain farms that will cultivate Corn on a very Large Scale, SMEs that will pre-process the Corn  into Industrial Raw Materials, Industries that will process the raw materials into finished end products which cut across pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics, food & beverages, chemicals, Animal feed, packaging etc., logistics, packaging and other supporting services.

It is expected to directly benefit over 10,000 rural residents through training, job creation, and improved livelihoods, while indirectly impacting tens of thousands more across surrounding communities through improved food security and environmental resilience.

The main sources of inputs and raw materials will come from local and regional suppliers. Drought-resistant seeds, tree seedlings, organic fertilizers, and farming tools will be sourced from agricultural research institutes and agro-dealers within Katsina and neighboring states such as Kano and Kaduna. Water for irrigation will be obtained through solar-powered boreholes and rainwater harvesting systems, while knowledge inputs will be drawn from partnerships with local universities, NGOs, and extension services.","Key stakeholders in this initiative would include government actors such as the Katsina State Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, alongside local governments and relevant federal agencies.

Large-scale agroforestry systems and value-added agro-industries will be fully developed and operational, driving rural industrialization and significantly expanding employment opportunities. Export revenues from processed agricultural products will grow, while carbon credit earnings from mature forest systems will begin contributing to both local and state revenues. Rural-to-urban migration is expected to decline due to improved livelihood prospects, and the local economy will show strong integration with national and international markets.

Looking ahead 50 years, the project will have laid the foundation for a fully diversified, climate-resilient rural economy in northern Katsina. Generational wealth will be more common in beneficiary communities due to long-term land productivity, intergenerational farm enterprises, and established agro-industrial infrastructure.

The Ministry oversees policy alignment, while companies handle technology deployment. Communities and NGOs will handle mobilization, monitoring, and local adaptation.","The NAIH will be implemented through a public-private partnership model, coordinated by a regional governance board aligning with the Northern Economic Agenda. Each hub will operate semi-autonomously, guided by clear KPIs on sustainability, job creation, and food output. Regular monitoring and stakeholder feedback loops will ensure transparency and adaptability.","The financial model is blended financing — a mix of government funding, World Bank grants, and private sector investment. The bankability rests on long-term produce sales, agri-tech licensing, and training program revenues. Hubs are expected to break even within five years of launch.","In 10 years, NAIH is projected to train 200,000 farmers and boost food security in 9 states. In 30 years, it will transform northern Nigeria into an agri-tech powerhouse, attracting exports and tech investment. By 50 years, it will be a model replicated across Africa, contributing to GDP growth, rural development, and national food independence.",Katsina

The Northern Economic Agenda represents a bold, visionary framework to catalyze sustainable growth across the region, transcending political divides to prioritize shared prosperity. Rooted in data-driven strategies and collaborative action, this agenda seeks to harness the North’s latent potential in agriculture, demography, and human capital while addressing systemic challenges such as the Almajiri crisis. Below, we outline transformative pathways aligned with our mission to foster economic resilience, equity, and innovation.  

**1. Agricultural Revitalization: From Farm to Future**  
Northern Nigeria’s vast arable land and favorable agro-ecological zones position it as the nation’s breadbasket. By investing in modern farming techniques, irrigation infrastructure, and value-chain development, we can boost productivity, reduce post-harvest losses, and create agribusiness opportunities for millions. Leveraging data analytics to identify high-yield crops and market trends will empower farmers to transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture. Furthermore, establishing agro-processing hubs in key states will attract private-sector partnerships, generate employment, and amplify export potential—turning agrarian strength into a cornerstone of regional GDP growth.  

**2. Demographic Dividend: Harnessing a Consumer Base and Tech-Ready Youth**  
With over half of Nigeria’s population residing in the North, the region’s consumer market is a goldmine for revenue generation. Formalizing informal sectors, expanding tax compliance mechanisms, and incentivizing SMEs to operate within regulatory frameworks can unlock substantial tax revenues to fund public services and infrastructure. Simultaneously, the North’s burgeoning youth population—equipped with rising digital literacy—holds the key to a tech-driven economy. By establishing innovation hubs, subsidizing STEM education, and partnering with tech giants to localize opportunities, we can cultivate a generation of entrepreneurs and coders poised to lead Nigeria’s Fourth Industrial Revolution.  

**3. Solving the Almajiri Crisis: A Model of Compassion and Pragmatism**  
The Almajiri system, while culturally rooted, has perpetuated cycles of poverty and insecurity. To address this, we propose a *community-led waqf (endowment) initiative*, rallying Northern elites—philanthropists, corporate leaders, and diaspora networks—to fund integrated educational centers. These institutions will blend Quranic instruction with Western curricula, vocational training, and psychosocial support, ensuring Almajiri children evolve into skilled, socially responsible citizens. Critically, we must also empower local Mallams (Quranic teachers) by incorporating them into this reformed system—providing training, stipends, and resources to align their roles with modern pedagogical standards. This dual approach preserves cultural identity while breaking the chains of deprivation.  

**4. Data-Driven Governance: The Backbone of Progress**  
Our agenda’s success hinges on robust data collection and stakeholder collaboration. By creating a regional economic observatory, we can map resources, track development indicators, and design policies grounded in real-time insights. Engaging traditional institutions, civil society, and the private sector will ensure solutions are culturally attuned and scalable. For instance, partnerships with universities can foster research on climate-resilient crops, while town hall dialogues with traders’ unions can refine tax frameworks to avoid overburdening SMEs.  

**Conclusion: A Call to Collective Action**  
The Northern Economic Agenda is not a dream—it is a actionable blueprint for equity and growth. By mobilizing the region’s agricultural might, demographic power, and intellectual capital, we can build an economy that leaves no one behind. Let us challenge Northern elites to lead by example, channeling wealth into waqf projects that uplift Almajiri communities. Let us empower our youth to code, farm, and innovate. And let us govern with data, empathy, and accountability.  

Together, we can transform the North into a beacon of inclusive prosperity—where tradition and progress coexist, and every child has the tools to thrive.

Specific objectives include:Enhancing Productivity: Increase agricultural output through the adoption of modern technologies, improved seeds, and irrigation systems to boost crop and livestock yields, addressing the region’s low productivity (e.g., only 57% of rice consumed is locally produced).Promoting Agribusiness and Value Chains: Shift agriculture from subsistence to a business-oriented model by strengthening value chains, fostering private sector partnerships, and supporting agro-processing to create jobs and reduce post-harvest losses.Ensuring Food Security: Reduce dependence on food imports (e.g., 3 million tons of rice annually) by scaling local production of staples like maize, cassava, and rice, aligning with Nigeria’s 2019 rice import ban.Empowering Youth and Women: Create inclusive opportunities for youth and women through training, access to finance, and digital agriculture initiatives, leveraging the region’s young population to drive innovation.Climate Resilience: Integrate climate-smart agriculture practices to mitigate the impacts of drought, desertification, and flooding, which severely affect Northern Nigeria’s agricultural hub.Sustainability of the PolicySustainability is central to the policy’s design, ensuring long-term economic, environmental, and social benefits:Environmental Sustainability: Promote sustainable land and water management through efficient irrigation (only 45% of irrigation potential is utilized in Northern Nigeria) and soil conservation techniques to combat land degradation and desertification. Policies will support climate-smart practices like agroforestry and drought-resistant crops.Economic Sustainability: Foster agribusiness development by incentivizing private sector investment in processing, packaging, and distribution. This builds on the success of initiatives like the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP), which enhances livestock sector sustainability through public-private partnerships.Social Sustainability: Engage communities through participatory approaches, such as farmer cooperatives and user-manager irrigation schemes, to ensure equitable resource distribution and social inclusion, particularly for women and youth.Institutional Sustainability: Establish robust institutions for policy monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation, drawing on lessons from past policies like the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (2011), which faced challenges due to poor management. Regular policy reviews and stakeholder engagement will ensure adaptability.Problem-Solving PotentialThe policy addresses critical challenges in Northern Nigeria’s agriculture sector, offering targeted solutions:Low Productivity and Food Insecurity:Problem: Smallholder farmers, who dominate the sector, face low yields due to limited access to finance, technology, and inputs, contributing to food insecurity.Solution: Implement programs like the Anchor Borrowers Program (ABP) but with improved access to microfinance, high-quality seeds, and mechanization. Expand irrigation schemes (e.g., Kano River Irrigation Project) to enable year-round farming and reduce reliance on rain-fed agriculture.Climate Change Impacts:Problem: Drought, desertification, and flooding reduce arable land and threaten livelihoods in Northern Nigeria, where temperatures can reach 42°C.Solution: Promote climate-resilient crops, invest in early-warning systems, and scale up renewable energy-powered irrigation (e.g., solar-powered systems) to enhance resilience, aligning with Nigeria’s Climate Change Policy (2022).Youth Unemployment and Rural-Urban Migration:Problem: High unemployment and lack of opportunities drive youth migration, exacerbating urban overcrowding.Solution: Create agribusiness hubs and digital agriculture training programs to engage youth in value-added activities like agro-processing and e-commerce, building on initiatives like the Feed the Future program.Weak Value Chains and Post-Harvest Losses:Problem: Poor infrastructure and limited processing facilities lead to high post-harvest losses and low competitiveness in global markets.Solution: Develop internationally certified packaging centers to tap into diaspora markets (potential $81 billion annually) and invest in cold storage and transport infrastructure to reduce losses.Insecurity and Farmer-Herder Conflicts:Problem: Insurgencies and herder-farmer clashes disrupt farming activities, particularly in the northwest.Solution: Expand the NLTP to modernize livestock systems, establish grazing reserves, and integrate peacebuilding initiatives with economic incentives to reduce conflicts.Policy SuggestionsTo operationalize the policy, the following actionable steps are recommended:Investment in Irrigation Infrastructure: Allocate funds to rehabilitate underutilized irrigation schemes and develop new ones, targeting at least 70% of Northern Nigeria’s irrigation potential by 2030. Partner with the World Bank and FAO for technical support.Agribusiness Incubation Centers: Establish regional hubs to train youth and women in agro-processing, branding, and marketing, with access to low-interest loans and digital tools.Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Collaborate with private sector players (e.g., Flourmills Nigeria, Promasidor) to scale agro-industrial projects, such as the Ikun Dairy Farm model, across Northern states.Climate-Smart Agriculture Fund: Create a dedicated fund to subsidize climate-resilient inputs and renewable energy solutions, such as solar-powered irrigation systems, for smallholder farmers.Policy Alignment with SDGs: Integrate the policy with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG-1 (poverty), SDG-2 (zero hunger), and SDG-13 (climate action), to attract international funding and ensure holistic impact.Strengthened Extension Services: Deploy digital extension services to provide farmers with real-time information on weather, markets, and best practices, building on USAID’s Feed the Future model",,https://haggkqvtqmlknovgkabl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/ideas/idea_documents/1745079968563-77zgy6bu8a8.pdf,2025-04-19 16:27:14.244903+00,,"1. Kano StateSuitabilityAgro-Ecological Advantage: Kano is located in the Sudan-Sahel agro-ecological zone, ideal for cereals (maize, sorghum, millet, rice) and livestock rearing, with a long history of intensive agriculture in the Kano Close-Settled Zone. The state benefits from seasonal rainfall (500–1000 mm annually) and established irrigation systems like the Kano River Irrigation Project.Market and Infrastructure: Kano is a major commercial hub with robust market networks, serving as a final market for agricultural produce across Northern Nigeria and the Sahel region. It has good road connectivity, proximity to international borders, and facilities like the Dawanau International Grains Market.Existing Agricultural Base: Kano is a leader in rice, groundnut, and livestock production, with 70% of households engaged in crop farming and significant livestock populations (e.g., 18.4 million cattle nationally, with Kano as a key hub).Impact Areas and PopulationImpact Areas: The project can enhance rice and maize value chains, promote agro-processing (e.g., rice milling, groundnut oil production), and modernize livestock systems to reduce herder-farmer conflicts. It will create jobs, improve food security, and boost exports to Sahel countries. Rural areas like Dawakin Tofa and urban centers like Kano City will benefit from agribusiness hubs.Population: Kano has a population of approximately 15 million (2022 estimates), with a high rural density (348 people/km² in some areas). The large youth population (60% under 25) offers a labor force for agribusiness, while urban demand drives processing and marketing.Sources of Inputs and Raw MaterialsInputs: Kano has access to improved seeds and fertilizers through local agro-dealers and programs like the Anchor Borrowers Program (ABP).

To address the challenges posed by the Almajiri system, a comprehensive reform is necessary. Here's a proposal:

""The Almajiri system should be integrated with formal primary and secondary education, incorporating vocational training and skill acquisition. Almajiris should return to their parents' homes and attend local LEA schools, where they can receive both Islamic and Western education. Mallams can be employed to teach Islamic studies, ensuring a well-rounded education.

The curriculum should include vocational skills like:

1. Carpentry
2. Blacksmithing
3. Tailoring
4. Agriculture
5. Entrepreneurship

This will empower Almajiris to fend for themselves and contribute to the economy. The government can partner with entrepreneurs and Kantin Kwari businessmen to:

1. Mentor young individuals
2. Provide apprenticeships
3. Offer business training and resources

The government must abolish street begging by Almajiris, a practice that perpetuates poverty and vulnerability.

This reform aims to:

1. Provide access to quality education
2. Eradicate street begging
3. Address the root causes of insecurity
4. Promote sustainable development
5. Equip Almajiris with vocational skills for economic empowerment

By integrating the Almajiri system with formal education and vocational training, we can create a brighter future for these children and contribute to the overall stability and prosperity of Northern Nigeria.","Funding Model and Financial Planning

Description: The Northern Youth Agro-Clusters for Sustainable Growth (NYAC-SG) is a transformative initiative focused on engaging exited N-Power Agro beneficiaries across the 19 northern states of Nigeria in sustainable agriculture. The project establishes structured clusters in each state—10 clusters per state, each with 10 graduate, unemployed youth—empowering a total of 100 participants per state to cultivate 2 hectares of farmland each. NYAC-SG addresses youth unemployment, land underutilization, and food insecurity by equipping participants with technical skills, access to inputs, extension support, and market linkages. The initiative champions climate-smart agriculture, promotes regional food sufficiency, and nurtures a new generation of agro-entrepreneurs. It aims to catalyze rural transformation and contribute to Nigeria’s national agricultural resilience agenda.

",,,2025-04-19 21:39:28.0543+00,,"Location, Impact Areas, Population, Inputs, and Scalability:
The Northern Youth Agro-Clusters for Sustainable Growth (NYAC-SG) project will be implemented across all 19 Northern states of Nigeria, with pilot clusters in Gombe, Kano, and Nasarawa States. The primary impact areas include rural and peri-urban communities with high youth unemployment and underutilized arable land. The project targets graduate youth who are exited beneficiaries of the N-Power Agro program, with a total of 1,900 beneficiaries (100 per state) in the initial phase.

Inputs such as improved seeds, organic and inorganic fertilizers, farm tools, and extension services will be sourced from local agro-dealers, research institutions (e.g., IAR, IITA), and national input supply chains. The model also encourages partnerships with state ADPs, cooperatives, and private agribusiness firms.

NYAC-SG is highly scalable, with a modular cluster design that can be replicated across various agro-ecological zones. Its success metrics—youth engagement, yield per hectare, income generation, and market access—will guide future expansion to more beneficiaries and additional value chain interventions.

","Mode of Implementation, Governance, and Sustainability:
The Northern Youth Agro-Clusters for Sustainable Growth (NYAC-SG) will be implemented through a decentralized public-private-community partnership (PPCP) model aligned with the Northern Economic Agenda. The project will be coordinated by a Multi-Stakeholder Steering Committee (MSSC) at the regional level, comprising representatives from government ministries, private sector players, development partners, and youth cooperatives.

Each state will host a State Agro-Cluster Coordination Unit (SACCU) responsible for cluster mobilization, input distribution, training logistics, and performance tracking. Governance will emphasize transparency, inclusivity, and accountability, with key performance indicators (KPIs) tied to youth employment, land utilization, food production, and market access.

Sustainability will be ensured through:

Capacity building and entrepreneurship training for youth farmers.

Cooperative formation for group input procurement and collective marketing.

Integration of climate-smart practices to boost resilience and productivity.

Gradual commercialization of clusters to transition into viable agri-enterprises.

This model is designed to empower youth, enhance agricultural productivity, and stimulate inclusive economic growth in line with the Northern Economic Recovery and Development Framework.

","Financial and Bankability Structure:
The financial model for the Northern Youth Agro-Clusters for Sustainable Growth (NYAC-SG) adopts a blended financing approach, combining public sector seed funding, development partner grants, and private sector co-investments. Initial funding will cover land preparation, input supply, training, and monitoring systems, with contributions expected from:

Federal and State Government allocations

International development agencies (e.g., IFAD, FAO, World Bank)

Private agro-input and off-taker partnerships

Youth cooperative contributions (minimal start-up equity or in-kind labor)


The project’s bankability is anchored on several revenue streams, including:

Sales of agricultural produce from the 2-hectare plots per beneficiary

Value-added processing and cooperative-managed storage and marketing

Long-term off-taker contracts with agri-processing firms and commodity buyers

Possible lease of mechanization services and agri-tech platforms


With proper yield projections and market access, each cluster is expected to reach operational sustainability within 3 years, with full cost recovery and profit-sharing mechanisms built into cooperative structures. The financial design enables scalability, investor confidence, and alignment with national and regional agricultural finance frameworks.

Year 1: Start-Up Phase (for one cluster of 10 youth farmers working on a combined 20 hectares)

The initial start-up cost is estimated at ₦2.4 million per cluster, covering expenses such as land preparation, improved seeds, fertilizers, small-scale irrigation systems, training, extension support, monitoring tools, and cluster coordination.

Projected Revenue:

Assuming an average yield of 2.5 tons per hectare and a market price of ₦150,000 per ton, each cluster (20 hectares) is expected to produce 50 tons of crops. This gives an estimated total revenue of ₦7.5 million in the first harvest cycle.

Annual Operational Costs:

Recurring costs such as inputs (seeds and fertilizers), transportation, marketing, extension services, and administrative expenses are projected at around ₦1.4 million per cluster annually.

Net Profit (Year 1):

Subtracting both the start-up and operational costs from the total revenue, each cluster could realize a net surplus of approximately ₦3.7 million in the first year. In subsequent years, after removing start-up expenses, the profitability improves significantly, enhancing financial sustainability and reinvestment potential.



","10-Year Outlook: Foundation and Expansion

Job Creation: Over 190,000 direct jobs created (100 youth per state x 19 states x 10 years), with indirect jobs in processing, logistics, and markets reaching over 500,000.

Agricultural Output: At scale, the project could contribute over 950,000 tons of food annually, improving regional food security.

Youth Empowerment: Thousands of formerly unemployed graduates become successful agro-entrepreneurs and cooperative leaders.

Economic Contribution: Generates billions in revenue through crop sales, reduces rural poverty, and stimulates micro-economies in farming communities.

Institutional Growth: Strong youth agri-cooperative networks established across the North, attracting further private sector investment.

We are looking at replicating successful the Tova Farms model in Tanzania which is funded by a  venture capital. 

Fadl Farms is an mini start up 1.5-hectare commercial papaya (pawpaw)
orchard located in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. We are strategically positioned to leverage the region’s fertile soil, favorable climate and growing demand for tropical fruits. With increasing health consciousness and a rising market for vitamin-rich fruits, papaya presents a lucrative agribusiness opportunity for both domestic consumption and export. 

Nasarawa State’s agricultural potential, proximity to major markets like Orange market Maraba, Abuja, Lafia and Keffi, and supportive government policies make it an ideal location for high-yield papaya farming. However, despite the crop’s profitability, many local farmers still rely on low-yielding traditional varieties with inconsistent production. Fadl Farms seeks to bridge this gap by introducing improved hybrid papaya cultivars such as Calina Ipb9 and Sunrise Solo, modern farming techniques and sustainable practices to maximize productivity, quality and market competitiveness. Nigeria’s informal retail market is practically on every street junction, hence a revolution
in the fresh fruit supply chain through organized retail is also a need for today. 

A papaya orchard of fruits and in close proximity to residential places in Abuja is an efficient business venture, as it will cater the necessity of a big chunk of young and needy working population for procuring quality fruits. Our farm occupies an eye-catching space

This vision stems from the urgent need to reclaim peace, rebuild public trust in institutions, and secure the lives and livelihoods of our people. The approach I propose is rooted in pragmatism, community participation, and institutional reform, with three core pillars:

1.	Build Strong, Adaptive, and Decentralized Security Architecture Through State Policing
The current centralized policing system has proven inadequate in responding to the complex and localized security challenges faced across the North. My policy vision calls for the establishment of State Police structures that are well-trained, well-equipped, and embedded within the local communities they serve. This will enable faster response times, better terrain understanding, and stronger relationships between officers and citizens. State policing must be anchored in professionalism, accountability, and legal oversight to prevent abuse while ensuring local solutions are prioritized in maintaining order.

2.	Promote Community Engagement in Security via Initiatives Like #SecureThePeace
Security cannot be achieved by the government alone; it requires the active participation of the people. Through the proposed #SecureThePeace initiative, I envision a network of Community-Police Partnerships where traditional leaders, youth groups, women’s associations, and civil society collaborate directly with security agencies. These platforms will serve as intelligence hubs, conflict mediation spaces, and early warning systems. The initiative also seeks to demystify security operations, improve trust, and give citizens a voice in shaping the strategies that protect them.

Sustainability:
Sustainable peace requires strong, competent, and professional institutions. This begins with a deliberate and systemic investment in law enforcement agencies, correctional services, and judicial structures.
1 - Training programs must be continuous, standardized, and tailored to the unique threats and cultural dynamics of the region. Officers should be trained not just in tactics but also in human rights, mediation, and community relations.
2 - Infrastructure upgrades are equally crucial, modern police stations, responsive communication systems, well-equipped operational units, and humane correctional facilities must form the physical backbone of this new architecture.
3 - Equally important is the establishment of performance-based evaluations and internal accountability mechanisms, which will help build a culture of professionalism, transparency, and service-oriented policing.",,https://haggkqvtqmlknovgkabl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/ideas/idea_documents/1745229968358-s4dzpgygjhp.docx,2025-04-23 18:22:20.442099+00,,"The security policy is designed to be adaptable across the broader Northern Nigeria geopolitical zone, a region that has, over the years, been the epicenter of some of the country’s most pressing security challenges. From terrorism and insurgency in the Northeast, to banditry and communal conflict in the Northwest, and herder-farmer clashes in the North Central, Northern Nigeria’s insecurity landscape is complex, diverse, and deeply entrenched. This policy framework offers a scalable, locally-rooted approach that can respond effectively to these dynamics.

Target Locations
The policy specifically prioritizes interventions in:
1 - Conflict-Affected Rural Communities
These are typically underserved and under-secured areas where violent groups exploit poverty, limited state presence, and weak infrastructure. Examples include:
Southern and Birnin-Gwari axis of Kaduna State,
Hinterland regions of Zamfara State affected by banditry and rural crime,
Post-insurgency communities in Borno State still vulnerable to terrorist regrouping.
These communities require urgent stabilization efforts combining law enforcement with economic revival and social cohesion initiatives.

2 - Border Communities with Transnational Security Risks
Many Northern Nigerian states share porous borders with neighboring countries. In particular, the long border with the Republic of Niger, especially across Yobe, Katsina, Jigawa, and Sokoto States, poses significant transnational threats, including arms smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorist infiltration. These border zones require enhanced surveillance, coordinated border policing, and integrated identity management systems.
","1 - National and State Assemblies
Role: Legislative Enablers and Policy Architects
The legislative arms at both the national and state levels play a pivotal role in providing the legal and institutional framework required for the success of the security policy. Without their active participation, reforms in policing, justice delivery, and community security structures would lack the legitimacy and operational grounding necessary for implementation. Their roles extensively spans: Enactment of Enabling Law, Oversight and Accountability, Budget Appropriation, Representation of Constituents’ Concerns.

2 - Nigerian Police Force & Security Agencies
(Including DSS, Nigeria Civil Defence Corps, and Immigration Service)
Role: Operational Executors and Tactical Responders
These institutions are the frontline actors responsible for the direct execution of security mandates. Their effectiveness, professionalism, and cooperation with other actors determine the success of peace enforcement and crime prevention efforts.

3 - Judiciary and Correctional Services
Role: Custodians of Justice and Rehabilitation
A strong, independent, and fair judicial system is fundamental to upholding the rule of law. Alongside it, a reformed correctional system ensures that offenders are rehabilitated, not radicalized. Together, these institutions uphold justice, enforce rights, and deter repeat offenses.","My idea is to fully support the passage of the State Police Bill, not because it is politically trendy or aligned with any party agenda, but because I believe it offers a real, practical, and localized solution to the worsening security situation in our region and across the country. Nigeria’s centralized police system, while noble in its original intent, has become overstretched, disconnected from local realities, and unable to respond quickly or effectively to the diverse security threats we face today: from insurgency and banditry to kidnapping, communal clashes, and urban crime. The current structure does not provide the responsiveness, accountability, or cultural intelligence that modern policing demands. That is why I believe in decentralized policing.  Under the proposed legislation, each state, including the Federal Capital Territory would be empowered to establish its own State Police Command, headed by a State Commissioner of Police, who would oversee all law enforcement operations within the state. However, I believe the implementation must be deliberate, well-thought-out, and built on a strong legal and financial foundation.
","The proposed policy is designed to draw funding from a diverse mix of:
1- State Government Budgetary Allocations
Core funding for recruitment, training, infrastructure (e.g., police stations, correctional centers), and equipment will be provided through annual state budget appropriations. Line ministries (Ministries of Security, Justice, and Local Government) will manage allocations in line with a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).

2- Security Trust Funds
States will be encouraged to establish State Security Trust Funds. These funds will support the purchase of vehicles, communications systems, forensic labs, and other capital needs.

3- Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
Infrastructure such as command-and-control centers, and community peace hubs can be delivered through PPP models, with incentives provided to private contractors under transparent agreements. PPP models may also be applied for building training academies or data integration platforms (e.g., identity systems).
","In the Short-Term to Mid-Term:

1. Stabilization of High-Risk Areas
With State Policing and community-based security in place, local economies in conflict-affected areas (Zamfara, Borno, Southern Kaduna, etc.) will begin to reopen for farming, trade, and investment. IDPs will gradually return home, allowing land use, housing, and labor to reenter the formal economy.

2. Growth in Informal and SME Sectors
Reduced insecurity will lead to a resurgence of small businesses, transport systems, and rural markets, contributing to an estimated 5–7% increase in state-level IGR in stable states.

In the Mid-Term to Long-Term:

1. Full Integration of Conflict-Affected Economies
States previously at the bottom of national GDP rankings due to conflict (e.g., Yobe, Zamfara, parts of Niger and Taraba) will have transitioned into functioning subnational economies, fully contributing to national productivity.

2. Deepened Private Sector Confidence
Investors, both foreign and domestic, will view Northern states as viable for manufacturing, renewable energy, agro-processing, and logistics investments. Multinational partnerships for mining, solar infrastructure, and regional trade corridors will increase.

3. Strong Local Governance and Tax Systems
Enhanced peace allows states to implement progressive taxation systems, improve property registration, and widen the revenue base, leading to financial autonomy and stronger institutions.

In the Long-Term:
1. order communities once plagued by smuggling and conflict will become hubs for formal trade and regional integration (e.g., Nigeria–Niger–Chad economic corridor). The North will become central to continental supply chains, especially under AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area).",Yobe

The primary, loud objective of this project is to build an inclusive, diversified, and prosperous economy for Kogi State and Northern Nigeria, harnessing all sectors — agriculture, mining, trade, technology, logistics, energy, education, health, tourism, and culture.

However, the silent, strategic agenda behind this vision is to position Kogi, and by extension Northern Nigeria, as a gateway for Africa’s integration into the global economy.
Through smart infrastructure (like dredged rivers and ports), dynamic trade, innovation hubs, and export-driven industries, Kogi will quietly but steadily evolve into a global player — connecting African resources, ideas, culture, and enterprise to the wider world.

⸻

Sustainability:

The project is designed for long-term, self-reinforcing growth through:
	•	Multi-sector development that reduces dependency and creates economic balance.
	•	Smart infrastructure (river ports, roads, digital networks) that ensures permanent local and international market access.
	•	Community-driven participation that builds resilience and ownership at grassroots levels.
	•	Environmentally responsible practices (eco-friendly dredging, green energy) to ensure ecological balance.
	•	Youth and technology empowerment to future-proof the economy and keep it competitive in a fast-changing global world.
	•	Strategic alliances and partnerships at national, African, and global levels to ensure financial and political sustainability.

By design, Kogi’s economy will sustain itself through internal strength while expanding outward through global linkages.

⸻

Problem-Solving Potential:

This project systematically addresses major structural challenges:
	•	Underdevelopment of Northern Nigeria by catalyzing investment, productivity, and inclusion.
	•	Youth Unemployment and Poverty by generating new industries, new jobs, and new enterprises.
	•	Weak Infrastructure by building river ports, logistics hubs, and technology parks.
	•	Food Insecurity by revitalizing agriculture and agro-processing.
	•	Poor Global Integration by creating export pathways and trade corridors directly linking local industries to Africa and world markets.
	•	Security Fragility by making economic opportunity available to all, especially vulnerable communities.
	•	Environmental Degradation by embedding sustainability practices into all sectors.

Ultimately, while solving immediate local problems, this project also quietly engineers Kogi’s global future — where Northern Nigeria becomes an African heartland for trade, innovation, and global partnerships.

Local Community
Traditional & Religious Institutions
Traditional & Religious Institutions, PLEASE Check attached document for for more information","Governance Structure
A Kainji Stability Council (KSC) will oversee the initiative, comprising federal/state officials, security agencies, traditional rulers, and community representatives. This multi-tiered body ensures strategic oversight, operational coordination, and grassroots input. Quarterly progress reports and traditional conflict mediation mechanisms will maintain transparency and trust. The structure embeds accountability while respecting local power dynamics.

Sustainability Framework
Financial sustainability combines dedicated state funding (10% of Niger's security budget) with private sector partnerships offering tax incentives. Institutional sustainability comes from training 500 local officials and embedding deradicalization in education. Community ownership is ensured through prioritized local hiring and monthly feedback forums. The plan leverages technology (biometric tracking) and environmental protection (reforestation) to address future challenges.

Alignment with Northern Economic Agenda
The initiative directly supports NEA pillars by: eliminating security threats to commerce, securing agricultural land for expansion, creating 5,000+ youth jobs in green industries, and formalizing cross-border trade. It transforms Kainji from a conflict zone into an economic node through integrated security-economic solutions, with risk mitigation against extremism, corruption and climate change woven throughout all phases. The holistic approach ensures stability unlocks the region's economic potential.

","The Kainji initiative proposes a blended financing model combining public funds, private investment, and international donor support. The ₦33 billion 3-year budget will be funded through federal/state allocations (60%), private sector partnerships (25%), and donor grants (15%), with clear cost allocation across security, economic recovery, and governance components. The bankability structure creates four revenue streams - trade taxes, agro-industrial sales, eco-tourism, and forestry licenses - projected to generate ₦8.5 billion annually by Year 5.

To attract investors, the plan offers 5-year tax holidays, sovereign risk guarantees, and blended finance options where development banks cover 40% of infrastructure costs. Repayment will come from 30% of Niger State's increased internally generated revenue and user fees from licensed activities. Financial sustainability is ensured through an exit strategy that transitions operations to private sector management, targeting 12-15% ROI by Year 7.

The model aligns with Northern Economic Agenda priorities by de-risking investment in fragile areas and creating youth employment through agriculture. Key risk mitigation measures include military asset protection, state-backed escrow accounts, and dollar-denominated contracts for international partners. This structure transforms Kainji from a security liability to a bankable economic zone by leveraging its natural assets and strategic trade routes while providing investors with layered financial and political safeguards.","Within a decade, the Kainji initiative is projected to transform the region into a thriving economic hub, delivering substantial gains across multiple sectors. The project will directly contribute ₦25-30 billion annually to Niger State's GDP through revitalized agriculture, formalized trade, and eco-tourism development. Key achievements include the creation of 12,000+ jobs, recovery of 80% of abandoned farmland, and generation of ₦5 billion in annual state revenue from taxes and licenses. The agricultural sector alone is expected to see 50% yield increases, producing ₦10 billion yearly from cash crops like rice and sesame, while the newly established Niger-Benin trade corridor will facilitate ₦15 billion in legitimate commerce.

The initiative's broader economic impacts include attracting ₦50 billion in private investment, reducing security costs by ₦8 billion annually, and slashing local youth unemployment from 45% to 18%. By converting Kainji National Park into a tourist destination and developing renewable energy infrastructure, the project diversifies the regional economy while supporting Northern Economic Agenda priorities. The most significant long-term contribution may be establishing a replicable model for post-conflict economic transformation, positioning Kainji as both a regional trade hub and proof that security stabilization enables sustainable growth. If fully implemented, Nigeria stands to gain a ₦100 billion economic zone by 2033, though underfunding could leave up to 40% of potential benefits unrealized.",Niger

The primary objective of the water and sanitation project in Kogi State, as part of the Northern Economic Agenda, is to harness the potential of the Niger and Benue rivers through strategic dredging and infrastructure development to improve water supply, agricultural productivity, energy generation, and sanitation. This initiative aims to provide clean water, irrigation, and power, supporting regional economic growth and contributing to the sustainability of Northern Nigeria.

This objective aligns with the broader goal of connecting West Africa and the global economy by enhancing regional integration, ensuring food security, and boosting energy supply through sustainable hydropower systems.

Sustainability

This initiative emphasizes the long-term sustainability of water resources and infrastructure. Key sustainable elements include:
	1.	Hydropower and Energy:
By dredging the Niger and Benue Rivers, the water flow to existing hydropower plants (like Kainji and Jebba Dams) will be increased, allowing for more consistent energy generation. This sustainable energy can power homes, industries, and water treatment plants, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
	2.	Irrigation and Agriculture:
Dredging will ensure that rivers provide adequate water levels for irrigation systems, especially in drought-prone areas. This supports agriculture by enabling year-round farming, reducing the risk of crop failure due to water shortages, and increasing food production for local consumption and export.
	3.	Water Treatment and Sanitation:
The project will improve access to clean water through modernized water treatment plants and sanitation infrastructure. This will promote public health, reduce waterborne diseases, and improve the quality of life in communities throughout Kogi and the broader northern region.
	4.	Environmental Protection:
The dredging initiative will enhance the capacity of existing dams and reservoirs, ensuring they can store more water, while also addressing climate change challenges. Proper management of water resources will help combat desertification and restore degraded land for grazing routes and farming.
	5.	Climate Resilience:
The project also enhances climate resilience by improving water retention in the region. This, in turn, helps mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, which are increasingly prevalent due to climate change.

Problem-Solving Potential
	1.	Water Scarcity:
The increased flow of water from dredged rivers will help tackle water scarcity issues, particularly in the north, which suffers from seasonal droughts and limited access to potable water. By ensuring a more reliable and sustainable water supply, it will provide clean water for communities, industries, and agriculture.
	2.	Agricultural Productivity and Food Security:
With access to better irrigation systems, the region can produce more food, contributing to food security. The Niger River, once dredged, will become a major source of water for irrigation across the region, supporting agriculture and ensuring a more resilient food system. This will reduce dependency on imported food products and improve local farmers’ livelihoods.
	3.	Reduction in Farmer-Herder Clashes:
The establishment of grazing routes and the provision of water for cattle can help mitigate the tensions between farmers and herders in the northern regions. By ensuring that herders have access to reliable water sources, it reduces the pressure on agricultural land and improves peaceful coexistence between these two groups.
	4.	Sanitation and Public Health:
By investing in sanitation infrastructure, such as modern sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants, the project will address the growing challenge of inadequate sanitation services in northern Nigeria. This will help in reducing waterborne diseases and improving overall public health.
	5.	Energy Deficit:
The increased capacity of the hydropower plants and renewable energy sources will help resolve the energy deficit in northern Nigeria. By improving the power supply, it will drive industrialization, promote economic growth, and increase access to electricity for rural and urban areas alike.
	6.	Regional Economic Integration:
By connecting Kogi State to neighboring regions and countries, including Niger, Chad, and Mali, the dredging project will facilitate the movement of goods via water transport, improving trade and investment flows. This regional integration is crucial for the economic development of West Africa and Africa as a whole.
	7.	Job Creation:
The project will also create job opportunities in sectors such as construction, engineering, agriculture, water management, and energy production, boosting the local economy and providing employment to both skilled and unskilled laborers.

Conclusion

Incorporating dredging, irrigation, sanitation, and hydropower into the Northern Economic Agenda will provide long-term solutions to many of the challenges faced by Kogi State and the broader northern region. This initiative will contribute to economic diversification, food security, energy sustainability, and environmental protection, supporting regional growth, peace, and prosperity, while enhancing the region’s global economic footprint.
